# PyWordle
Simple interactive wordle solver playing with some python concepts.

The basic loop looks like:
    while not done:
        Choose a word
        Score the word

The score is a 5 character sequence of the characters: g, y, x.  These represent the green, yellow, or blank squares scored by Wordle.
